### Hi there 👋

My name is João Paulo (👨🏻‍💻 ) and I am a Front-end Developer and UI Designer from Brazil, based in Curitiba (🇧🇷 ).

I like working as freelancer, solving problems with Design and making great ideas happen. I love sharing the knowledge that I have gained from my experience with other people. When I am not developing websites I like to produce electronic music (🎛️ ), play some records (🎧 ) and practice sports (🏃🏻‍♂️ ).

You can find me on Twitter [@jpf909](https://twitter.com/jpf909/) and, if you're interested in my professional experience, please have a look at my links below or drop me a message.
