### Hi!üëãüë®üèª‚Äçüíªüáßüá∑

My name is Jo√£o Paulo Fricks, and I am a software developer and designer from Brazil, currently based in Curitiba.

I enjoy working as a developer, using my skills in coding, design, and UX to solve problems and bring great ideas to life. Sharing knowledge and experience with others is also a passion of mine. When I'm not developing software, I like to spend time with my family, take walks with my dog, produce electronic music, play records, and practice sports.

If you're interested in my professional experience, please have a look at my **side projects** or feel free to drop me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joaopaulo80). You can also find me on [jpcmf.dev](https://jpcmf.dev).

### Side projects

I maintain and develop the following projects, continuously creating new features, testing, and implementing improvements. Many of these projects were born out of a desire to explore new techniques and technologies, and they serve as a way to learn something new every day. Think of this as my public lab‚Äîfeel free to explore, provide feedback, or contribute if you'd like!
